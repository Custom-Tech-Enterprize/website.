## ATTENTION!
Do NOT touch the SASS.
Do not apply sass --watch app/sass:app/css and then try to fix the mess without making a new branch of it.
It WILL break the styling, no lie and you will have to spend a looooot of time trying to get it working the way
you think it is supposed to be.
It needs it's **own ticket and branch to get it done**
